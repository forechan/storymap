                <p>Located on the Columbia River in Washington State this dam was created by Mason-Walsh-Atkinson Kier Company
                  and finished in 1942. Further add-ons of creating the third power plant was finished in 1974 to supply
                  the Pacific Northwest with the growing demand of power. Standing at 550ft high and a length of 5233ft,
                  this concrete gravity dam produces more than 21 billion kilowatts-hours of electricity each year(usbr).
                  The Grand Coule Dam is the largest dam in the United States when it comes to generating power attracting
                  many tourist each year. Clean energy such as renewable energy is vital for the future as it is cheaper
                  and more environmentally friendly as the earth gradually gets warmer.</p>
                <p>Even though this dam has been one of the greatest engineering projects in United States it does not come
                  without a cost. There has been many proposal from environmental activist groups to find out ways to preserve
                  endangered species such as Salmon and Trout as there numbers are dwindling. Currently, there has been many
                  efforts by state and federal government to address the solutions of endangered species. No doubt this is an
                  iconic dam that will possibly not taken down until its decommision in the future.</p>

                <p>Located on the Columbia River in Washington State 1.5 miles upriver from Bridgeport Washington
                  it is the second largest hydroelectric power producer in the United States (US Army Corp of Engineers).
                  this dam was authorized as Foster Creek Dam and Powerhouse for power generation and
                  irrigation by the River and Harbor Act of 1946 and completed in 1955. The River and Harbor Act
                  of 1948 renamed the project Chief Joseph Dam in honor of the Nez Perce chief who spent his last
                  years in exile on the Colville Indian Reservation. Because of its lack of fish ladders. Since this
                  is not able to store large amounts of water in it's resevoir, another dam called Wells Dam needs
                  to flow water at the same rate.
                </p>
                <p>The Chief Joseph dam attracts many visitors each year while many recreational acitvities
                  excist around the lake and the area. It is a favotire spot for anglers which have major game
                  fish such as Walleye, Rainbow Trout and triploid. Even though there is an abundant amount of game fish
                  the Chief Joseph Dam blocks all Salmon from coming upstream which is one of the biggets reasons in there
                  decline in population size. Balancing wildlife population and clean energy is important when it comes to
                  the future.

                <p>The Robert Moses Dam is located 4.5 miles from the iconic of the Niagara Falls. As it is New Yorks
                  biggest energy producer providing up to 2.6 million kilowatts of clean energy from its massive turbine.
                  The power plant is part of the New York Power Authority (NYPA). The dam began construction in 1957 and
                  was finished in 1961. The dam was proposed by then president and governor Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1914.
                  The hydroelectric has served many benefits such as producing cheap, safe and environmentally power. The
                  Robert Moses Dam is one of cleanest producing energy generators in New York and has had many upgrades in
                  in the past decades to keep hydroelectric power avaliable for all customers especially when it comes to the
                  supplying electric vehicles as there popularity increases.
                </p>
                <p> Economically the dam is valuable tool in New York's economy as it protects more than 27,200
                  jobs (the municipal) wiht more upgrades being put in to it. As dams provide a abundance of clean and
                  renewable energy they come at an environmental cost. The geographic location of New York where it has
                  waters coming from Canada provides a great source of constant energy but the impact of wild life will
                  need to be assesed more to fully understand the wildlife impacts. Not enough research has been done but
                  the dam is proving that is is much cheaper and more sustainable than using fossil fuels.

                <p>The John Day Dam is located 28 miles east of The Dalles, Oregon just below the mouth of the John Day River.
                The dam began contruction in 1958 and was completed in 1971 which is the newest dam on the Lower Columbia
                watershed. Built and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with the capacity to produce 2,160 mW from its
                16 generators. The John Day Hydropower Dam is 1975 ft in length and 184 ft tall. The dam underwent major structural
                repairs in the lockgate 2010 and a fish passage which was documented by National Geographic. It is a cool documentary
                to see.
              </p>
                <p>As the dam is located in the Lower Columbia River which is a major spawning ground for many endangered salmon and trout
                species there has been many projects to improve endangered species population. The U.S. Army of Engineers is obligated to
                to find ways to preserve, mitgate and protect endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. Efforts such as the creating
                a fish pathway has been succesful in redirecting and providing these aqautic species with thier spawning grounds to provide for
                other critical recreational activities that will boost the Oregons economy.

                <p>The Hoover Dam is a concrete gravity dam in the located in Boulder City, Nevada in the Black Canyons of the Colorado
                River on the border between Nevada and Arizona. Constructed from 1931 to 1936, the Hoover Dam was testimony to the American people
                that great success can still be built even when the economy was at it one of its lowest points. This construction
                efforts took thousands of workers, many who travelled from many states to find work in the peak of the Great Depression.
                Hoover Dam holds the largest resevoir volume of any dam in the United States. Essentailly, it holds the whole Lake Mead.
                Th dam provides Power to California, Nevada & Arizona.
              </p>
                <p> Hoover Dam fulfilled the goal of disseminating the one-wild Colorado River through the parched Southwest landscape,
                  fueling the development of such major cities as Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Phoenix. To these day, the Hoover Dam is a well
                  known place and familiar to everyone as it is always something great to talk about. Capable of irrigating 2 million
                  acres, its 17 turbines generate 4 billion Kilowatts-hour of power, enough electricity to power 1.3 million homes.
                  The dam was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985 and one of Americaâ€™s Seven Modern Civil Engineering Wonders
                  in 1994. It receives some 7 million visitors annually, while Lake Mead with almost 10 million visitors each year (History.com)
