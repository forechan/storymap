                <img src="Fushimi-Inari-Shrine-Torii-Gates-Curve.jpg">
                <p>Fushimi Inari Shrine is located in Kyoto. I have personally
                  visited this shrine myself when I went to Japan. There are lots
                  of torii gates that create a tunnel and it is very beautiful.
                  This shrine worships foxes as their gods.</p>

                <h6>Photo by Getty Images</h6>
                <p>The John Day Dam is located 28 miles east of The Dalles, Oregon just below the mouth of the John Day River.
                The dam began contruction in 1958 and was completed in 1971 which is the newest dam on the Lower Columbia
                watershed. Built and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with the capacity to produce 2,160 mW from its
                16 generators. The John Day Hydropower Dam is 1975 ft in length and 184 ft tall. The dam underwent major structural
                repairs in the lockgate 2010 and a fish passage which was documented by National Geographic. It is a cool documentary
                to see.
              </p>
                <p>As the dam is located in the Lower Columbia River which is a major spawning ground for many endangered salmon and trout
                species there has been many projects to improve endangered species population. The U.S. Army of Engineers is obligated to
                to find ways to preserve, mitgate and protect endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. Efforts such as the creating
                a fish pathway has been succesful in redirecting and providing these aqautic species with thier spawning grounds to provide for
                other critical recreational activities that will boost the Oregons economy.
